This is the day before the course begins. We've flied to Montreal and checked into our dorms. The subway in Montreal is quite lovely, and the buildings are beautiful. However, I am a bit worried that everyone else will be far more experienced than I am. My plan is to use Markup to analyze the texts of Lafcadio Hearne, a folklorist and journalist. However, I am not sure exaclty what I should do with this project. I am also relatively inexperienced with Markup., the coding language this course uses. However, the only way to improve is to start. I will go over the readings again tonight, and hope for the best for tomorrow.
