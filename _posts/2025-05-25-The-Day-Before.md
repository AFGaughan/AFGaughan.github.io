# May 25th - The Day Before

Well, today is May 25th, the day before the course begins. I have completed my flight to Montreal, and the other students and I have checked into the dorms. The buildings are quite beautiful, and the subway system is amazing. I am a bit nervous about tomorrow, because I have a less concrete project to continue, and am relatively inexperienced with Markdown, the coding language I'm using to make this blog right now. However, I guess that the only way to improve is to start. The planned texts that I will be exploring, unless I am pushed in another direction by the instructor, are the writings of Lafcadio Hearn, a journalist and folklorist whose writing is still used in Japanese Literary/Myth courses today. I am going to go over the class readings tonight and hope for the best. I am curious to see what other class members are working on.
